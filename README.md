Each dataset contains a range of fields offering comprehensive financial, operational, and management insights, essential for assessing the performance, size, and operational scope of the mutual funds. These datasets, which are primarily numerical and financially oriented, serve as critical tools for performance tracking, investor reporting, and ensuring compliance with regulatory standards.
